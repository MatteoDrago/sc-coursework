\subsection{Building similarity matrix}

As explained above we started by considering user-based collaborative filtering. In order to apply this paradigm, we need to build a similarity matrix between users. The equation that gives \textit{Paerson coefficient} for similarity is given in \ref{eq_1}.

The procedures that involve the construction of the similarity matrix, exploiting \textit{sqlite} in C++ environment, are the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item primo elemento
	\item secondo elemento
\end{itemize}
