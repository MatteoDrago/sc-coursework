\section{Conclusions}

Initially the computation of similarity matrix required an almost infinite amount of time. We managed to reduce considerably this time, using \textit{dense google hash maps}, exploiting parallel computation and adopting some tips, as explained in previous sections. Anyway all the efforts were employed in achieving a complete similarity matrix. Given that we've been stuck in optimizing similarity matrix computation, in the end we didn't have enough time in order to conduct a copious prediction compaign by varying parameters such as the neighborhood size or trying different threshold of similarity for determining the most similar users. Therefore, this is why we are not able to provide more results regarding our recommendation system, despite the huge amount of work carried out to fulfill the goals of this coursework.

We managed anyway to produce some predictions and we tried to deal with cold start problem as well as we could. In conclusion, the results uploaded have been obtained using a standard approach based on what studied during lectures.
